# Project Overview

We are proud to have won 3rd place in the **No-Code Pitchathon Track** organized by **EasyA x VeChain x BCG**.

Since our solution was conceptual and did not involve coding during the hackathon, we have outlined the following technical considerations for the development phase.

## Tech Stack

For the development of this app, we plan to use the following technologies:

- **React Native**:  
  We will use React Native for mobile app development, enabling us to build a cross-platform solution that supports both Android and iOS.

- **Express**:  
  Our backend will be powered by an Express server, providing a lightweight and flexible framework for building APIs and managing business logic. This tech stack is aligned with the VeChain dApp tutorial, making it easier for us to integrate with the VeChain ecosystem.

- **AWS**:  
  We plan to deploy the application on AWS, utilizing services such as S3 for storage, EC2 for server hosting, and MySQL for database management.

- **Unity**:  
  Unity will be used for game development, allowing us to create an interactive gaming experience that integrates seamlessly with the mobile app.

- **VeChain**:  
  To be part of the VeChainBetter DAO ecosystem, we will integrate the VeChain blockchain. We plan to use the [VeChain x-app-template](https://github.com/vechain/x-app-template), which will accelerate our development process and ensure compatibility with the VeChainThor blockchain.
